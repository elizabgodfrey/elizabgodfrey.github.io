<h2>
	Which two websites are you most inspired by?
</h2>
<p>
My final project will be to build a website for my consulting business, so I took a look at websites of similar agencies. The two I liked the most were <a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a> Creative Butter and <a href="www.method.com"></a>Method
</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a>Creative Butter does a good job of sectioning off their homepage so that all of the important information is easily accessible to the site visitor. It provides a good &#146at a glance&#146 overview. </p>

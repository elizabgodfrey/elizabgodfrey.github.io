<h2>
	Which two websites are you most inspired by&#63;
</h2>
<p>
My final project will be to build a website for my consulting business&#44; so I took a look at websites of similar agencies&#46; The two I liked the most were <a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a> Creative Butter and <a href="www.method.com"></a>Method
</p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space&#44; size or balance&#63;
</h2>
<p><a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a>Creative Butter does a good job of sectioning off their homepage so that all of the important information is easily accessible to the site visitor&#46; It provides a good &#146;at a glance&#146; overview&#46; </p>
<p>
<a href="www.method.com"></a> Method&#146;s design is even cleaner and more straightforward&#44; with a clear link to client case studies that showcase their work&#46;  	
</p>
<h2>
What makes them similar and different&#63;
</h2>
<p>
Both have a clear and basic delineation of sections&#44; and both allow the user to scroll the homepage to obtain the pertinent information&#44; so they are both mobile&#150;friendly&#46; I like how there are clear links to their past work&#46; 	
</p>
<p>
The <a href="www.method.com"></a>Method site is a bit more user friendly&#44; because there is less going on&#46; <a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a>Creative Butter has several sections where there is an automatic scroll&#44; and that is somewhat distracting&#46;

<strong>Homepage</strong>	
</li>	
<img src="homepage">
<p>In the first sketch of the homepage&#44; the focal point is the cluster of four images&#44; while in the second sketch&#44; the focal point is the hero image above the other four&#46; </p>
<li>
<strong>About Me</strong>	
</li>
<img src="about me">
<p>
In these sketches&#44; the focal point is the image&#44; which is on the left hand side in the first iteration and the right hand side in the second&#46;

<h2>
	Which two websites are you most inspired by?
</h2>
<p>
My final project will be to build a website for my consulting business, so I took a look at websites of similar agencies. The two I liked the most were <a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a> Creative Butter and <a href="www.method.com"></a>Method
</p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance
</h2>
<p><a href="www.creativebutter.com"></a>Creative Butter does a good job of sectioning off their homepage so that all of the important information is easily accessible to the site visitor. It provides a good &#146;at a glance&#146; overview. </p>
<p>
<a href="www.method.com"></a> Method&#146;s design is even cleaner and more straightforward, with a clear link to client case studies that showcase their work.  	
</p>
<h2>
What makes them similar and different?	
</h2>
<p>
Both have a clear and basic delineation of sections, and both allow the user to scroll the homepage to obtain the pertinent information, so they are both mobile&#150;friendly.

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I&#146;m a freelance digital marketing professional, living in Santa Monica. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because now that I&#146;m freelancing, and don&#146;t have the resources of a full marketing team, I&#146;m finding that I need to be able to do a little coding as well.</p>
  
  <h2>My Mission</h2>
  <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day be able to make modifications to company websites and other digital platforms with little or no help from developers. My ideal client is in the fashion or luxury space because I like to work in an artistically creative environment.</p>
